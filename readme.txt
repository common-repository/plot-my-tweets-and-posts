Plot your blog posts and/or tweets on a Google Map in date order with a path tracing your route.

== Description ==

* Perfect for road trips, holidays, gap years, cycle tours or tracking any kind of tour.

* Add the shortcode [plotmypostsandtweets] to a page to embed the Google Map on that page.

* Turn on geo-tagging in your Twitter account to automatically place your tweets.
( How to turn on geoocation: see http://bit.ly/npLtHp )

* Alternatively, finish your tweets with "at town, state" e.g. "Just had soup for lunch at Santa Cruz, CA". Or enter the location in square brackets e.g. "Just had soup for lunch [Santa Cruz, CA]"

* Add a custom field called 'Location' to the posts you would like to appear on the map, and enter the town or city you are posting from.
(If custom fields aren't visible in your Edit Post form, add it from the 'Screen Options' dropdown at the top of the page)

* You can amend the locations of any tweets and posts from the Posts/Tweets Map page in the 'Posts' menu.

* You can set up the display options for the map in the Posts/Tweets page in the 'Settings' Menu.
